# Express + MongoDB starter code for social todo homework

This is some starter code for the social todo homework. You can
inspect the `package.json` file to see what libraries we are using
here. The most important are [Express](http://expressjs.com) and
[MongoDB/Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com).

## Getting started

You will need Node set up on your machine.
Clone the code, `cd` into the
code's directory and then download your dependencies with
`npm install`. This will populate your `node_modules` directory
with everything I used to complete the homework. Of course, you are
free to add and remove dependencies as you like for your solution.

## What I did for you

I did the models and all the code needed to hold everything together. After
I finished the homework, I replaced my controllers and views with dummy code.
_You do not have to use the same controllers and views as me_. You can use
any functions, routes, and views that get the job done. For that matter, you
are free to alter the models. This code is only to help you---you don't need
to use it.

## Running the code

This code needs a few environment variables in order to run: `DATABASE_URL` and
`PORT`. You can also specify `HOST` and `SESSION_SECRET`. The `index.js` file, which
is the entry point, is the only file that reads variables from the environment.

When I completed the homework, my environment variables looked like this.
```
PORT=5000
SESSION_SECRET="NPOicW7oKb4rQKR+tHnMdGm0rh5W/d2/nUL3O0Y+5+E="
MONGO_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017/social-todo"
```

(You can get a good session secret by running the command
`openssl rand -base64 32` on a system where openssl is installed.)

Having set your environment variables and started MongoDB,
you can then run the code like

`npm start`

which will start it with nodemon, as shown in the `package.json` file.
